# Read this before getting the program for the first time (or when updating the program)

Current version: v1.00 (Gooey Marks)

To get this program follow this:

https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository

Or just click download zip (from the drop down menu called "Code").

If you are downloading Engineering_results for the first time follow the steps below:
1. Rename results_example.txt to results.txt (or duplicate results_example.txt and then rename)
2. Open Terminal (cmd on Windows)
3. Navigate to the directory where you have downloaded the Engineering_results file
4. Run the following code next: "python3 results.py"
5. Enter your marks into the respective courses

If you are coming from v0.0x follow the steps below:

1. Open Terminal (cmd on Windows)
2. Navigate to the directory where you have downloaded the Engineering_results file
3. Run the following code: "python3 make_results_file.py" (you must only run this program once)
4. Run the following code next: "python3 results.py"
5. Enter your marks into the respective courses 
(in decimal or quotient format -- i.e. 0.96 or 24/25 -- if you only have percentages, divide the value by 100)

You will have to re-run the results.py program if you want to see the marks in the "Current Marks for semester" screen.

Please let me know if you encounter an error in the program :)

Ignore the section below if downloading for the first time.

## Keeping your program up-to-date: How-to
You have two methods to choose from.

#### The easy method:
Download the latest version of the results.py and replace the current two files in your directory with the latest 
versions.

(Make sure that results.txt is in the same directory as the new results.py otherwise it'll break)

Run the program.

#### The hands-on method:
View the changelog corresponding to your current version of the program and adjust the program accordingly.

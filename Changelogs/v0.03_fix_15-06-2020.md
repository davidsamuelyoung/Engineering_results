This README is meant for the users currently on v0.03 of the results.py program and 
who want to "dive" into the code and fix the errors themselves.

Only applies to version 0.03, if you have a later version and you want to fix it yourself, find your corresponding 
version in the Changelogs folder and follow that document :)

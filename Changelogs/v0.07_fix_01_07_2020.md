### CSC1015F CALCULATOR INCORRECT (Jul-01-2020)

####Problem:

The mark calculator is was returning a remaining mark larger than 0% when all the tests are complete.

#### LINE 220 TO 232

Change the mark calculation to:

    # Assignment Average = 0.9 * Weekly Assignment Average + 0.1 * Quiz Average
    assignment_avg = 0.9 * (ass_avg[0] / 7) + 10 * (quiz_avg[0] / 7)
    assignment_avg_lost = 0.9 * (ass_avg[1] / 7) + 10 * (quiz_avg[1] / 7)

    # Practical Test average  = pt_avg/2
    # Prac_Average = (3/5 * Assignment average + 2/5 * Practical test average)
    prac_avg = (3 * assignment_avg + pt_avg[0]) / 5
    prac_avg_lost = (3 * assignment_avg_lost + pt_avg[1]) / 5

    # TheoryTest_Average = theory_avg / 3
    # Course_mark = 0.625 * Prac_Average + 0.375 * TheoryTest_Average
    course_mark = 0.625 * prac_avg + 12.5 * theory_avg[0]
    course_mark_lost = 0.625 * prac_avg_lost + 12.5 * theory_avg[1]

#### LINE 234 TO 235

Change the print(...) statement to:

    print("For CSC1015F (DISCLAIMER - This is an estimate; not 100% accurate):\nYou have: {}%\n"
          "You have lost: {}%\nRemaining: {}%".format(round(course_mark, 2), round(course_mark_lost, 2), round(
            100 - course_mark - course_mark_lost, 2)))

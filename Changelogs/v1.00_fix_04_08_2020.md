This README is meant for the users currently on v1.00 of the results.py program and 
who want to "dive" into the code and fix the errors themselves.

Only applies to version 1.00, if you have a later version and you want to fix it yourself, 
find your corresponding version in the Changelogs folder and follow that document :)

### EEE1007S MARKING SCHEME RELEASED (Aug-04-2020)

#### Problem:

In v1.00 the user would never see the marks they were receiving for EEE1007S because no formula was available to 
calculate said course mark.

#### Line 117 to 122

Change:

    elif 'test_' in k and course == 'mam1021s':
        have += eval(v) * 20
        lost += (1 - eval(v)) * 20
    elif 'test_' in k and course == 'phy1013s':
        class_tests_have += eval(v)
        class_tests_lost += 1 - eval(v)

To:

    elif 'test_' in k and course == 'mam1021s':
        have += eval(v) * 20
        lost += (1 - eval(v)) * 20
    elif 'test_' in k:
        class_tests_have += eval(v)
        class_tests_lost += 1 - eval(v)

This removes the check for the course being PHY1013S therefore allowing the class test mark for 
EEE1007S to be added to class_tests_have and _lost. 

#### Line 126

Change:

    elif 'assignment_' in k:

To:

    elif 'assignment' in k:

The underscore was interfering with the program gathering the marks for 
the EEE1007S assignment.


#### Line 176 to 177

Change:

    have = 0
    lost = 0

To:

    have = class_tests_have * 35 + assignment_have * 30
    lost = class_tests_lost * 35 + assignment_lost * 30
    
Added the course mark calculation formula for EEE1007S

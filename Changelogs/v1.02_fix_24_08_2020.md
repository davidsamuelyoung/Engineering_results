This README is meant for the users currently on v1.02 of the results.py program and 
who want to "dive" into the code and fix the errors themselves.

Only applies to version 1.02, if you have a later version and you want to fix it yourself, 
find your corresponding version in the Changelogs folder and follow that document :)

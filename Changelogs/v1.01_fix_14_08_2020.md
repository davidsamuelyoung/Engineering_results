This README is meant for the users currently on v1.01 of the results.py program and

### PHY1012F CALCULATOR MISSING AND BROKEN WRITING (Aug-14-2020)

#### Problem:

1. I forgot to add the code to calculate the PHY1012F marks.
2. Biggest f-up in my programming career: the IF-statement handling which line 
                                               in the results.txt file needs to be updated with new marks 
                                               was choosing to write duplicate results to future assessments.
                                               Notably, WPS's, quizzes... basically assessment group which had 
                                               more than 9 in the semester.

There was too much code I had to restructure to fix this so I didn't add a line-by-line change.

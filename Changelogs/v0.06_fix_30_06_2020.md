This README is meant for the users currently on v0.06 of the results.py program and 
who want to "dive" into the code and fix the errors themselves.

Only applies to version 0.06, if you have a later version and you want to fix it yourself, 
find your corresponding version in the Changelogs folder and follow that document :)

### BUG IN CODE & MINOR IMPROVEMENTS (Jun-30-2020)

Please re-download the code, this was an "overhaul" of the code itself, 
and I just didn't feel like documenting the changes this time xD

#### But for those interested:

I added some error handling to the physics mark calculation... the program would break if the result for a 
lab was entered in decimal/integer (i.e. 1 or 0.67) format instead of a quotient (i.e. 25/25 or 2/9).

Also removed some repetitive strings in main()
